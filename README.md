### Abstract
With the widespread use of algorithmic curation systems in recent years – the automated, personalized selection and ranking of online content – growing concern over the nature and implications of their biases has been voiced by both their creators and users worldwide. Social networks in particular have been accused of exhibiting some form of bias, resulting in damaging filter bubbles and large scale misinformation spreading. \
In this work, we make the case for a systematic approach towards mitigating polarization in personalized recommendation systems using concepts from reinforcement learning theory. To this end, we investigate multi-armed bandits and their more complex variation, contextual bandits, which factor in user information and can dynamically adjust rewards and future recommendation accordingly. We also examine recommendation independence, a set of statistical methods which ensure fair representations in curation systems where sensitive data is involved. Our frameworks are illustrated on three curated datasets (YOW, MovieLens and a synthetically-generated one for the purposes of this dissertation). \
Through extensive experimentation and comparison with state-of-the-art techniques, we show that our described frameworks provide adequate balance between user satisfaction and diversity of content.
